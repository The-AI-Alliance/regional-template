# Making Smaller Contributions

You may not have the time or the expertise to be extensively involved, but you can easily make suggestions for small improvements. Contributing changes as [pull requests](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/REPO_NAME/pulls){:target="prs"} is the best way to contribute (and most welcome!). Alternatively, consider [posting issues](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/REPO_NAME/issues){:target="issues"}. 

For this documentation itself, the sources are in the GitHub repo's [`docs`](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/REPO_NAME/tree/main/docs){:target="repo-docs"} directory. 

Also notice that every page on this website has _Edit this page on GitHub_ links, making it easy to view a page, then go straight to the source to make edits and submit a PR! This is the best way to help us fix typos and make other small improvements.

The repo [README](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/REPO_NAME){:target="repo"} explains more details about contributing to this project.

However, all these ways of contributing require you to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one and you want to provide feedback for improvements, then [send us email](mailto:contact@thealliance.ai) with your suggestions. Be sure to mention this particular website, as we have many AI Alliance project websites that look similar!
